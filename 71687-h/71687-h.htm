<h3 class="ls">PREFACE.</h3>
<hr class="short">
<div class="tall">
<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">This</span> treatise comprises light and heavy salting,
saccharine and muriatic preservative fluids, drying
by gentle heat and air currents, smoking with woods,
peat and turfs, marinating of fish and bucaning<a id="fnanchor_A" href="#footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> of
meats, and the whole processes of potting, preserving,
and pickling.</p>

<p>That there exists a necessity for such a work as
this, is but too evident from the disappointments experienced
every summer, not only by those who purchase
at the shops, but the heads of families, who,
replenishing their store-rooms annually, reasonably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span>
expect that every article, when produced at table,
will meet its meed of praise.</p>

<p>Hams, hung meats, cured tongues, &amp;c., as well as
the more expensive sorts of fish, as smoked and kippered
salmon, are often so loaded with salt as to be
hard, tough, and barely eatable; and, on the other
hand, are often found in a state of slow decomposition,
unwholesome and disgustful.</p>

<p>To obtain perfection in this art, much more depends
upon the fuel made use of than is generally
supposed, and I have herein adapted the different
sorts of wood, &amp;c., to the particular articles to be
acted upon.</p>

<p>To render this manual available to all classes of
society, from the butteries of the nobility to the more
humble cupboard of the tradesman, as also to the
proprietors of Italian warehouses, of hotels, refreshment-rooms,
and to fishmongers, pastrycooks, &amp;c. &amp;c.,
I have laid down rules and receipts in intelligible
language and arrangement, and I trust that there is
not a single instance in the whole of these pages,
where any noxious or deleterious ingredients are recommended
to be used, and by which the stomach<span class="pagenum" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</span>
and system are made to suffer to please the eye and
the palate.</p>

<p>Instructions for an exceedingly useful and cheap
apparatus for curing and smoking is appended, as
well as the best method of keeping, for a length of
time, every description of goods so cured and preserved.</p>

<p>Amongst the marinated fish and bucaned meats
will be found many of the most delicious specimens
that a nicely discerning judgment could dictate, and
which are certain of extensive patronage, after having
been once partaken of.</p>

<p>I beg to refer my readers to the “Notes” at the
conclusion of this work, as exponents of gross errors
long cherished in the old common practice, and of
facts so self-evident as not to be resisted.</p>

<p class="p2 footnote"> <a id="footnote_A"></a><a href="#fnanchor_A"><span class="muchsmaller">[A]</span></a> “Bucaning” is a method of preserving meats, &amp;c., partly by drying
and partly by smoking with the <em>embers</em> of wood fires, and
retaining all the palatable and nutritious juices. It must have had
its origin with the rude hunters of the forests, who, for want of a
chimney, laid sticks across, at a proper distance from the heat.</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<hr class="short">

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">AN APPARATUS FOR DRYING AND SMOKING.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">I recommend</span> this apparatus, having, for many
years, employed exactly such an one in my own
business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Chimney</span> should be three brick walls of light
structure, a back and two sides, to be run up to the
height of about nine feet from a paved floor. It
must be open in front for a yard high from the
bottom, and then a wooden door-frame must be put
in, to carry a door five feet high, or, preferably, two
doors, each two feet six inches, one above the other,
the advantage of which will be seen when you come
to make use of it. Above this door there must be
brick-work again, for one foot higher, and then the
top must be covered over. The inside of the chimney
must be one yard wide, and two feet six inches deep,
that is, from the front to the back. On each side
there must be fixed a framework of wood, with strips
one inch square, nailed across at the distance of six
inches apart, these reaching from the bottom of the
door-frame and terminating within a foot of the top
of the chimney; on these strips will rest your spits or
rods when laden with fish. Six inches from the top,
two or three iron bars, with movable hooks running
on them, must be fixed in the brickwork, which will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
be able to sustain the weight of sides of bacon, hams,
salmon, &amp;c. &amp;c. A sheet of strong wire-work, or a
plate of sheet-iron, perforated with many holes half
an inch in diameter, must be fixed upon the bottom
of the door frame. This will distribute the smoke in
its ascent, and receive any small fish that may fall
from the spits while being smoked. Six inches from
the top of the chimney a wooden pipe six inches
square must be introduced, to carry the smoke out of
the room or shed, and in this must be put a valve or
slide, which, when shut, will increase the volume of
vapour in the chimney, and when opened will discharge
the same; thus you will have the force of the
fumigation completely under your command. A door
of light sheet-iron should be hung at the open space
at the bottom of the front, and so as to be let down or
kept open at your pleasure, by means of which the
heat from your fire may be reduced as necessity may
require, by letting in the cold air, and this can be let
down partially or totally when it is desirable to increase
the draught. This iron door must not reach
quite to the floor, but leaving about six inches open,
to keep a small current of air always in the chimney.
This construction has many advantages over the old-fashioned
close-fronted chimneys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Spits, or Rods</span>, must be of any tough wood,
perfectly round and a little pointed at one end, half
an inch diameter and three feet long. These are for
bloaters, &amp;c. For sprats and other small fish, you
must have spits of iron wire, also a yard long, and
pointed bluntly. For split mackerel, kippered
herrings, &amp;c., you must have deal rods of inch square<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</span>
wood, and with <em>wrought</em>-iron sprigs, two inches long,
driven through them, and protruding on the other
side, on which the shoulders of the various sorts of
fish must be fixed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Horses</span>, on which the rods must rest while
drying the fish, must be plainly made by fixing two
upright posts, in figure like the Roman capital letter
T <em>inverted</em>, thus ┴ at the distance of three feet from
each other, by means of two or three connecting rails.
The posts may be six feet long, with strips of wood
nailed across them six inches apart; on these will rest
all the different sorts of rods when loaded with fish,
and will correspond with the wood-work inside of your
chimney.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">FUEL FOR SMOKING.</p>

<p>Oak lops, or the extreme branches of that tree,
such as charcoal is made from in the country places;
it may be procured in large towns from manufacturers
of rustic chairs and garden seats. Dried fern
and short grass, the latter being pared off the heaths
and short pastures, very thin, and well dried in the
air. Beech and birch chips, or sycamore, are used
with all fine goods. Peat or bog-earth must be procured
on account of its preservative and deodorising
quality; it imparts a wonderfully mild and truly
acceptable flavour mixed along with other fuel.</p>

<p>Oak sawdust must be from the dry, old, <em>heart</em> of
oak trees; the outside slabs will not do, as being full
of sour sap. It is needless to say all these should be
quite dry when taken into your stock, and kept so, for
it will not suit your purpose to have a damp fume in
your chimney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span></p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">PRESERVATIVES.</p>

<p>All the <em>manufactured</em> white edible salts impart a
bitter taste to meats and fish cured by them, particularly
if the same are to be kept many months. This
is the reason why bay salt is so much used in part,
along with the common salt, and if bay salt was less
expensive, it would be universally used, and alone. I
cannot recommend too strongly the use of the <em>rock</em>
salt of the Cheshire mines; it acts similarly to the bay
salt, and is by no means expensive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Foots of Sugar</span> can be got from the wholesale
grocers, and is much preferable to the common sorts
sold. It is nearly double the strength, and is not so
rank and mawkish in the flavour it gives. There is a
quantity of it at the bottom of every cask of the West
India sugar when first opened. It is preferable to
treacle in many respects. To store your goods when
cured, and to keep them in the best possible state of
preservation, there is nothing so well adapted, and
proved by experience to be effectual, as malt cooms,
which should be contained in chests and boxes, with
little bags of pulverised charcoal here and there distributed
throughout. Hanging up hams, tongues,
smoked meats, &amp;c., in paper or calico bags, from the
ceilings of kitchens, and all habitable rooms with
fires in them, is an old, but very thoughtless, custom,
for all the foul air in an used room is accumulated
near the ceiling.</p>

when cold, pour it gradually and evenly over the
meat, and leave it. You can take thin pieces out in
a fortnight if wanted in haste, but it will be preferable
if not disturbed for a month. The water requisite for
the second brine depends upon what brine was produced

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">THE NUTRIMENT IN FISH.<p>

<p>“This is a subject on which I have made some experiments,
the results of which go far to prove that
there is much nourishment in fish—little less than in
butcher’s meat, weight for weight; and in effect it
may be more nourishing, considering how, from its
softer fibre, fish is more easily digested. Moreover,
there is I find, in fish—in sea-fish—a substance which
does not exist in the flesh of land animals, viz. iodine,
a substance which may have a beneficial effect on the
health, and tend to prevent the production of scrofulous
and tubercular disease—the latter in the form of
pulmonary consumption, one of the most cruel and
fatal with which civilised society, and the highly
educated and refined are afflicted. Comparative trials
prove that, in the majority of fish the proportion of
solid matter—that is, the matter which remains after
perfect desication or the expulsion of the aqueous part,
is little inferior to that of the several kinds of butcher’s
meat, game, or poultry. And if we give our attention
to classes of people, classed as to the quality of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
food they principally subsist on, we find that the
ichthyophagous class are especially strong, healthy,
and prolific. In no other class than that of fishers do
we see larger families, handsomer women, or more robust
men, or a greater exemption from the maladies
just alluded to.”—<cite>Dr. Davy.</cite></p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">WELSH DRIED SALMON.</p>

<p>A great deal of the Welsh salmon is “poached,” or
taken surreptitiously, in the long dark nights, by
means of lanterns and “spearing,” when the fish, attracted
by the light, come to the water’s edge. The
salmon is often lank and out of season, and consequently
of inferior quality, yet some of it is tolerable
and inquired for at the shops by gentlemen, who
having resided some time in Wales, and, as it often
happens, prejudiced in favour of home productions.
However, if it possesses any admired flavour it arises,
not so much from the method of curing it, as from
the fuel it is smoked with, and which the poachers
can easily procure, to wit, dried fern, and young
gorse, besides short grass turfs which grow on commons
and on the mountain sides, and which is pared
off the land very thin, and dried in the sunny weather.
They dry and smoke the salmon in some remote part
of their cottage, or hut, and hence its dark and dirty
appearance, and there it remains until traders intending
it for the Chester and Bristol markets come
and purchase it. I conclude it pays the curers pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
well for their trouble, since it costs them nothing.
Take a fresh salmon, sixteen to twenty pounds weight,
split it open at the belly, beginning at about eight
inches from where the tail sets on, and cutting through
to the bone up to the nose, remove the gills and all
the refuse, wipe well out, and quite dry. Mix an
ounce of ground white pepper with a pound of coarse
sugar, and rub all the inside with it, particularly at
the bone, for fifteen minutes or more; then bring the
sides together, lay it on a dish, and rub the remainder
of the mixture all over the outside of the fish, the
back fins and thick part of the shoulders. So let
it lie, the thin side uppermost, until next day in a
cool room. Then rub again all over with the liquor
produced, and let it lie twenty-four hours longer, the
thick side uppermost. Now hang it up by the tail
until dripping ceases, lay it again on a clean dish,
strew fine salt well over the inside, bring the sides
together, and rub the outside well with fine salt, leaving
the fish covered to the thickness of half-a-crown
with pounded rock salt, a thin stratum of which must
be under the salmon. Each day the runnings must
be thrown away—for observe it is hot weather when
fresh salmon is cured—and more salt applied. In
five days from the commencement it will be safely
cured, provided that the thick part of the back and
shoulders have been well supplied with the salt heaped
under, around, and above those parts. Then take up
the fish, brush off the salt, wipe dry, prop the sides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
open with splints of wood, and hang it up by the tail
in a current of air. Next day hang it up by the
<em>head</em> for twelve hours, and after that remove it to
your chimney, where, suspended with the head downwards,
you may smoke it with beech chips two parts,
oak sawdust two parts, and fern or grass turfs two
parts, for two weeks, keeping the sides wide open with
splints of wood. As soon as the salmon is taken out
of smoke, and while it may be a little warm and
pliable, lay some well dried oat straw in the inside,
bring the sides together and tie round with string.
In two months you will have prime dried salmon for
broiling in steaks, cut three quarters of an inch thick,
and will keep good many months.</p>

<p class="unindent">mix them well, and rub the skin side of the fish all
over, using a large handful. Lay your fish flat on
a good layer of common salt—rock is far preferable—in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
your tub, strew bay leaves on it, cover well with
your mixture, and put your boards on the fish, weighting
them down with accuracy. Remove them once
a day for the purpose of applying more of the seasoning,
and put fresh bay leaves on the third morning.
On the fifth morning take the salmon out of
the pickle tub, stretch it open at the back by wooden
splints, rinse it quickly through salt and water, and
proceed as in the next receipt, in every respect, until
the process is completed.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">SUPERIOR KIPPERED SALMON.</p>

<p>Choose a short, thick fish with a small head, a
bright eye, and of twenty pounds weight, although
salmon cannot be too large for splitting, and just
fresh from the ice they come packed in. Immediately
it is brought home—in hot weather observe—commence
your operations. Lay the fish on a table with its
back towards you, and, beginning at the nose, draw a
sharp knife clean down at one stroke to within two
inches of where the tail begins. This must be accomplished
so that the backbone is left quite bare
under the knife; thus one, the under, side of the fish
will be thicker than the upper side. Then take out
the roe and liver, which may be beautifully preserved
as by various receipts in this treatise, and removing
the gills and garbage, wipe out the fish well, and
having previously with a pen-knife severed a tissue
that runs along the whole length of the bone, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
hides much coagulated blood. <em>Pure water</em> must not
be allowed, but salt and water may be used to assist
in cleaning out the fish—that is, cloths dipped in salt
and water. In the next place we must have the backbone
detached, to effect which “nicely,” you will
need a pen-knife with a strong blade, or one of those
used by shoemakers for “paring,” and which are the
smallest used by them. Commencing about eight
inches from the root of the tail, the knife must be run
up by the side of the bone to the head, and then beginning
again at the same start, you must pass the
knife on the lower side of the bone, and so meeting
with the point of the instrument the incision made
by the first cutting, thus the bone may be got out,
and afterwards the meat so pared down as to appear
as though the fish never had a backbone. The necessity
for thus taking out the bone is, that handsome
slices may be cut from the thick side for broiling.
Now, when thus far advanced, make a layer of finely
beaten rock salt, or bay salt, at the bottom of your
pickling tub, and on that lay the salmon, its scaly
side downwards, and with a fine bread-grater cover
the whole inside of the fish with finely rendered loaf-sugar,
to the thickness of a crown-piece, and put
plenty of bay leaves upon that, place your flattening
boards nicely on the fish, and weigh them down effectively.
These must of course be displaced once
a day to supply more sugar to the fish. On the third
morning put fresh bay leaves, with a pound more salt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
and an ounce and a half of sal prunelle, and replace
the boards. Look to it every morning and evening,
keeping it well supplied with fine salt and sal prunelle,
but using no more sugar. On the fourth day sprinkle
lightly over it finely ground white pepper, and renew
the leaves. Next day dismiss the boards, bring the
thin side over upon the other, and, scattering salt over
it, leave it till the next day. Then rinse it quickly
through salt and water, and hang it up to drip; wipe
it dry, stretch out the sides by pieces of light lath
placed across the back, and suspend it in a free
current of dry air; examine it occasionally, and if the
red side begins to feel clammy or sticky, place it before
a fire until the “face” becomes somewhat dry
and hardened, then expose it again to the air current,
and when ready smoke it with</p>

scale it, remove the fins, cut off the head with two
inches of the jowl, and the tail with six inches of the

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">BRITISH AMERICAN SALMON.</p>

<p>Annually, in November, we get from St. John’s,
N.B., excellent salted salmon in tierces, dexterously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
split at the backs, and which, if treated in the following
manner, makes tolerable kipper. If it is your
purpose to convert two or more fish at once, choose
them nearly of the same size, and lay them in a
shallow tub with plenty of soft water and salt, so that
they are totally immersed for twenty-four hours; then
take one up, lay it on a table, scale side downwards,
and with scalding hot water and a middling soft
brush clean the face of the red side, by drawing the
instrument down always in the same direction with
the grain of the fish; it will be quite necessary to use
a small knife in paring away loose films which attach
to the middle of the belly and about the vent. This
done, turn over, and brush the skin side until clean,
and looking well to the fins and gills. Now lay the
fish in plenty of cold water, in which three-quarters
of an ounce of common washing soda to each gallon
has been dissolved; change the water every twelve
hours for thirty-six hours, if the fish weigh about nine
pounds each, and so in proportion for greater or less
weight. You will now let the fish lie in <em>pure</em> cold
water for six hours, then hang them up to drip for
twelve hours, and, taking them down, brush the red
side quite smooth, stretch open at the back by means
of wooden splints, and hang them to dry in a free
current of air, watching the inside faces to prevent
their getting clammy or sticky, and presenting them
to the fire should that be the case. In a day or so you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">BLOATERS.</p>

<p>This process is generally conducted in so negligent
and rough a manner—excepting at Yarmouth and
Lowestoft—that a little advice on the subject may not
be out of place. As the barrels are emptied of their
contents, the largest fish should be picked out from
the rest, and pickled separately, for otherwise the
consumer gets the finest herrings hardly tasting of
salt, and most likely in a state of decay, while
the small ones are so much oversalted, as to be
scarcely eatable. As the fish generally come to hand
far from clean, they should be washed by means of
round baskets agitated in tubs of salt and water, and
turned into separate pickling vats, which should have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>
false bottoms in them, perforated here and there with
holes, taps also being introduced to let off the pickle
when required. The safest and best method is to
make use of <em>saturated solutions</em> of salt, which are
made by adding twenty-nine pounds of common salt
to seventy-one pounds of water. The herrings will
float in this pickle, but must be totally immersed by
battens of wood laid on the top of them, and held
down by little bags of salt, which, being gradually
dissolved, will maintain the strength of the solution,
which is always lessened as the fish imbibe the
muriatic property thereof, and all pickles of this
description are weaker at the surface than at the
bottom, and may in this way be rectified. (See Note,
No. 4.) As to the length of time the fish should
remain in the pickle, that depends whether they came
to hand with coarse salt scattered amongst them, at
the sea coast, a precaution necessary in hot weather;
a good criterion is when the fish begin to be stiff or
rigid while being handled, but to try one or two
cooked is certainly a sure proof. Pure <em>fresh</em> water
must never be added or made use of in this process
after salt has been imbibed, or the heads will all be
broken when putting them on the spits. When salt
enough, run off the brine, and shortly commence
putting your fish on the rods, and hang them up in
a current of air, then remove them to your chimney,
and smoke them with</p>

the air currents, as they keep much better on the rods
until wanted. If a constant and full smoke has been
kept up, twelve hours will be sufficient for the smaller
fish, and sixteen to eighteen hours for the large ones.
They are not intended to keep good more than four
or five days, but in perfection should be eaten the day
after being cured.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">KIPPERED HERRINGS.</p>

<p>The herring is so favourite a fish with the majority
of society, that any improvement in the modes of
curing them is a valuable acquisition. The getting
rid of the gut and other objectionable parts recommends
itself, and claims a decided preference over the
old practice of sending the fish to table <em>whole</em>, and, in
fact, carrying to the parlour what ought to have been
left in the scullery. The salting process should be
conducted in a similar manner to that for bloaters, and
when taken out of pickle, should be wiped dry, and
then split open at the backs, leaving the bone bare as
possible; yet, an inch from the tail, the thin side should
remain attached to the thick side, this adds much to
the appearance of the fish when at table, and saves
the curer some trouble in the succeeding stages of
process. Clean out all the offal and gills, and wipe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
with cloths dipped in salt and water, and suspend
them by the shoulders upon the tenter hooks of your
rods, thus avoiding the trouble caused by the old plan
of keeping the fish open by splints of wood. Hang
them in a free current of air, and when dried enough—one
night is generally sufficient for that purpose—hang
them in the chimney, and smoke them of a
nice chesnut brown colour, and keep them on the
rods, but <em>not</em> in a current, though in a dry room
and cold air; when packed it should be insides faces
together, with strips of dry oiled paper between each
two fish.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">SUPERIOR SPICED KIPPERED HERRING.</p>

<p>This is a more troublesome, but withal a delicious

wash them a minute in salt and water, having taken

if procured soon after they are drawn from the

these fish in such abundance that it induces
curers to save them by various processes; the small
ones may be converted as follow: Split them open
at the belly, right over the backbone, clean away all
the garbage, gills, &amp;c, and lay them in a strong brine
of common salt until nicely flavoured, then hang
them on your tenters, dry them a day or two, taking
care they do not become clammy, as these fish very
soon are spoiled. Make a fire in your chimney with
oak lops, sawdust, and beech chips, and when you
have brought it to embers put in the rods, and first
dry and then smoke them highly. Whitings are
often done the same way, when the markets are

wages. I have found the following to be the best
method: Provide a wooden trough eight feet long
by a yard wide, and eighteen inches deep; fix strips
of wood an inch square along the sides, lengthwise of
the vat, and six inches above one another. On these
will rest the spits, which must be of iron wire, a

out all the small fish and rubbish, and wash the bulk
in salt and water, as for bloaters, but not too many at
once, as they are apt to sweat if lying long together,
and then would never be bright when smoked. Use a
saturated solution of common salt, or, preferably, of
rock salt, and if you intend to produce “bloated
sprats,” two hours will be sufficient to let them remain
in pickle; run off the brine, and put the fish
on the spits, which may be a little pointed at one end.

<p>Many gentlemen who delight in highly smoked
relishes, inquire for these articles, and as they are seldom
to be procured north of the metropolis, I subjoin
an easy way of getting them. In the beginning of
the sprat season—November—take a bushel of fish,
pick out all the largest ones, and with a dozen pounds
of common coarse salt or rock salt at hand, throw a
layer of it into the bottom of your salting tub, then a
layer of fish, and so on in alternate layers to the end;
let them lie four hours, mixing them about in the tub
two or three times, this will fix the scales, which are
cleared off the fish by the “washing” process. Now
take the sprats up, and with a basket wash them
quickly in very strong salt-and-water, using the same
salt if you choose, and get them on to your spits, and
dry them as soon as a strong current of air will accomplish
it. Smoke them with oak alone, lops and
sawdust, until they are of a very dark red colour, and
when quite cold, pack them in round shallow kits, in
circles, the heads lying all one way, and the fish on
their backs. The appearance of them is anything but
inviting, yet they are very good, and are always eaten
without cooking. Vast quantities used to be exported<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>

stagnant, when they run to large sizes, are said to
taste of the mud they inhabit. I have experienced
the truth of this. Take fresh eels of two pounds
each and upwards, cut off the heads, tails, and fins,
split them open at the belly to the backbone, from
the vent upwards, and clean them out, well washing
them also in salt and water a minute or two. Next

<p>These are inquired for by foreigners, and especially<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
by the Israelites, who are connoisseurs in fish, as
generally admitted. If many are likely to be wanted
you may save forty per cent. by purchasing a barrel
of anchovies “first hand,” and feeding them yourself.
You have another advantage also, viz. you
would insure the fine racy flavour, which is gradually
lost where the shopkeeper is perhaps two months or
more in selling out a barrel in small quantities. A
barrel turns out, in general, about twenty-two pounds
of neat fish, exclusive of the sauce, and not often
more. Acting on this advice, and feeding them, you
will be able to take out what you want, without breaking
the rest, and be careful to keep those in the
barrel well covered with the salt, and after that the
slate which you always find in the barrels of genuine
fish.</p>

<p>Run thin wire through the shoulders of the fish,
and making a light temporary frame to hold the wires,
smoke them with beech and oak, with some fern or
grass turfs. As no wiping nor washing is required
in this instance, the scales will have adhered to the
fish, and a general rough appearance will be the
result, this is a great recommendation to goods of this
class. They must be of a coarse brown mahogany
colour, and should be packed in boxes, the size and
shape of cigar-boxes, and made of wood that has
neither smell nor taste. Dried bay leaves must be
packed with them, about forty in each box.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">BIRMINGHAM TRIPE.</p>

<p>It is not less strange than true, that this excellent
preparation cannot be procured in perfection except
in London, Oxford, Birmingham, and Coventry, the
first of which is supplied principally from Birmingham.
The more independent and established of the preparers
of this delicacy refuse to communicate the secret of
the process to strangers, and my own curiosity cost
me a guinea some few years ago, besides my expenses
from Lancashire and back again. As will be seen,
however, plenty of cold and of boiling water, with an
adequate amount of diligence, are the main requisites,
which I liked the better, since in the whole of my
practice I have eschewed the use of drugs and
chemicals, as tending to rob what is estimable by nature
of its purity and flavour. The butchers in this
case leave nearly all the fat attached, and which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
absolutely necessary to the richness of the tripe when
cooked. It is forbidden to interfere with the bellies,
as they are termed, until the day they are wanted,
and they are therefore hung up in an outer-house.
The cleansing commences with scraping off the rough
dirt with a dull edged knife, and, proceeding in this
way, scraping until you come to the most troublesome
and tedious part, viz. the “honeycomb,” and every
one of those little cells of which it is composed is to
be attacked with a dull pointed knife, until, by assiduity
and great patience, the work is completed. The
process is forwarded by occasionally dipping the flesh
into the boiling water, which is always close at hand.
And beautifully sweet are these parts of the beast
made by these means, without a grain of lime or salt,
or any chemicals. The part when cleaned is washed
in two or three fresh waters, then cut into large pieces,
and put into a tin jar made on purpose, nearly covering
the meat with soft water, and sent off to the
common bakehouse to be left in—after the bread is
withdrawn—for five or six hours. When it is brought
home, a teacupful of <em>new</em> milk is put into the liquor or
gravy, in the tin, stirred about for a minute or so, and
the business is completed.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">CALF’S HEAD BRAWN.</p>

<p>A fine large calf’s head is best adapted for this

for four or five days, rubbing it a little each time;
pour over it four ounces of West India molasses (eight
ounces for the whole head), and continue to turn it
every day, and baste it with the brine very frequently
for a month, then hang it for a night to drain, fold
each part separately in brown paper, and send it to be
smoked for three or four weeks. When wanted for
table, wash and scrape one half of it very clean, but
do not soak it. Lay it with the rind downwards into
a saucepan or stewpan, which will hold it easily, and
cover it well with cold water, as it will swell considerably
in the cooking. Let it heat rather slowly,
skim it thoroughly when it first begins to simmer, and
boil it as gently as possible from an hour and three
quarters to a couple of hours or more, should it not
then be perfectly tender quite through, for unless
sufficiently boiled, the skin, which greatly resembles
bacon, will be unpleasantly tough when cold; when
the fleshy side of the head is done, which will be
twenty minutes or half an hour sooner than the outside,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
pour the water from it, leaving so much only in
the saucepan as will just cover the gelatinous part,
and simmer it until this is thoroughly tender. The
head thus cured is very highly flavoured, and most
excellent eating. The receipt for it is new. It will
be seen that the foregoing proportion of ingredients,
with the exception of the treacle, is for one half of the
head only, and must be doubled for a whole one.</p>

seven heads of celery sliced, and from which the tops
have been cut off, seven or eight anchovies, two ounces
of mace, four eschalots, minced, and four large carrots
cut into small pieces; set these on the fire and
shake them often to prevent their burning until the
butter and juices have attained a brown colour, then
pour in as much water as will cover them, and let it
simmer four or five hours; then strain it through a
hair sieve into another saucepan; darken the colour if
you think proper, and let it simmer by the fire till it
becomes glutinous. Great care must be taken that it
does not adhere to the pan and become burnt. You
may now add cayenne pepper and salt to your taste,
and pour it out on to dishes a quarter of an inch thick,
and when nearly cold cut it into cakes, which may be
packed in tin cases between writing paper, and kept
in a cool dry place. A pint of boiling water poured
into a basin on one or two of these cakes, will immediately
produce soup of very superior flavour, which
will be found a great convenience, especially in travelling.

<p>In France, in the Channel Islands, and Belgium

while in England very few persons make them
at home, but purchase at the shops an indescribable
mass of groats, blood, bread, herbs, &amp;c., and frequently,
to cover the indolence of the pork-butcher,
loaded with such an amount of the commoner spices,
as to render the whole anything but palatable. Then,
again, the fat, which seems to be the only recommendation,
is found here and there in lumps so large, that
before they become heated through, it is certain the
other of part of the mass must be burnt nearly to a
cinder. I think that we can produce an article well
worthy of the trouble and slight expense incurred by
the trial. Take a couple of dozen of large onions,

intimately, and if you find the mixture is too thin to
work well, add a handful or two of stale bread
crumbs, or half to three quarters of a pound of rice,
boiled just tender but not mashed. Take now the
smaller pudding skins which have been properly
scraped and cleaned, wash them in salt and water,
and with a tin funnel tie one end of the skin tightly
upon it, and the other end up in a knot, two feet or
a yard will be a convenient length. Proceed now to
fill your skins by pressing the meat through the
funnel, pricking with a pin to let out the air. When
nicely and firmly filled, tie up the end, and put the
puddings into a flat large pan, with plenty of water

lightly over with a linen rag dipped in olive oil, and
broil them ten minutes. Serve them plain, but very
hot. If you cannot procure endive, you may substitute
celery, which must be boiled along with three or
four laurel leaves; the tender parts only must be used.

although the spectators might nearly beg them, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
price being so low, few persons only would know
what to do with them, they not being “poor men’s

would be too expensive; the operatives have not seen
pies made of them, like eels, so even the million as
they are termed do not enjoy them, and ten to one
the beautiful fish are lost; whilst if they were near
Houndsditch or the Minories, amongst the Israelites,
they would not remain half an hour unsold even at

prepare them, and delicious indeed are the majority

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">MARINATED SHRIMPS.</p>

<p>To ensure this delicacy of first-rate quality you
must buy your shrimps alive, and boil and pick them
at home with all possible despatch. Set a gallon of
live shrimps in three quarts of boiling water, in which
one and half pounds of bay or rock salt has been dissolved,
and boil them fifteen minutes, then strain off
the water and as soon as possible commence shelling
them, and keep them covered with cloths as you proceed.
Be particular that no refuse or pieces of the
shells remain to disgrace the preparer, and laying them
lightly on clean dishes, mix amongst them the following
seasoning in very fine powder, being well sifted
and dried the day previous and kept bottled up. I
repeat that the shrimps must have been deprived of
all their moisture with the assistance of a moderately
cool oven, and not two fish to be seen sticking
together. Nor can any excuse avail in this instance,
as the less time that is occupied in potting these sorts
so much better chance will there be of your total success
in the product.</p>

<p class="unindent">When seasoned to your entire satisfaction, the fish
however fully retaining their own fine flavour, fill
your pots, which must be the cleanest and best dried
possible; press the shrimps well down, and set them as
you proceed at the mouth of your cool oven until
there is no evaporation observable. Now take them
up, press down again, and laying one or two bay
leaves on the top, fill up with the best olive oil, and set
away in a cool dry room. Next day replenish the oil
that has been absorbed, and not till after the third day
tie bladder over. Plenty of oil must cover the fish,
and although potted shrimps are not expected to keep
well after three or four days, yet you may expect every
satisfaction from this process. If decay soon takes
place, it will be owing to the fish not having been well
dried in the process. As to the preservation of the

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">POTTED CRABS.</p>

<p>To meet with well potted crabs is a very rare occurrence,
and, speaking generally, is attributable to the
carelessness of the preparer. Crabs are very often
out of season, that is, cannot be got without great
trouble and expense, and they are very much liked;
these admissions furnish reasons why we should have
some well preserved. Take half a dozen eastern coast
crabs—those of Hartlepool and neighbourhood are
always sound and well flavoured, while those on the
western coast and about Ireland are little worth—plug
up all the holes with wooden pegs, throw them into a
tubful of salt and water and brush them <em>thoroughly</em>,
then wash in pure water and put them into boiling
water to be cooked; then take them up and lay them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
to get cold; pull off the claws and put the large shells
into a slow oven after having run off any water that
may have collected in them, and when no more steam
arises from the slow drying, set them also to get cold.
Take all the meat out of the claws, pick out very
carefully all the little skins and strings, cut it into
dice and pound it in a mortar with clarified butter until
of a nice plastic mass, which cover up in a cloth. Now
attack the body shells, pick out all the solid meat, and,
setting the coral aside, throw out all the skins and refuse
you can find, and beat up this also with best
Durham mustard, as for the table, some cayenne, chillie
vinegar, and table salt. Place some of this at the
bottom of each pot, and having ready this seasoning,
mix what is requisite with the meat from the claws:</p>

<p>As this sort of animal food can only be got at one
season of the year, I recommend any person who is
fond of good eating at a moderate cost, to get the two
sides or flitches of a prime fat buck, and cure them in
the two different ways herein described, with full assurance
that the result will be perfectly satisfactory.
Take a side and hang it up in a free current of air as
long as ever you can trust it, wiping it daily with a coarse
cloth, and dusting it over, particularly the fat parts,
with ground black pepper, to prevent the flies settling
on it. With a sharp knife take off the outer skin,
and, removing all sinews, bone it nicely; divide it next
into pieces fit for collars, that is, so that when rolled
up the ends may be level and firm. Rub vinegar well
over the meat and leave it packed closely in a deep
dish and covered up till the next day. Make ready a

and with this rub the meat, which should have been
dried with cloths well, and pack them down to lie forty-eight
hours. Then take them up, and cutting slices of
hard fat bacon, half an inch wide and six or eight
inches long, insert them in channels cut in the venison
and about two and a half inches apart; this should be
done with consummate nicety. Now roll up the meat
into collars and bind tightly with broad tape, and sew
strong unbleached calico all round the length. Lay
paper shavings in the bottom of a deep straight-sided
jar, and upon them six or eight laurel leaves and twice
as many bay leaves, and place the collars lightly upon
them, then pouring in half a pint of water, tie doubled
paper over the jar and bake slowly for three hours at
least, or until nicely cooked; then while warm pour off
the gravy into a basin to get cold, and taking out the
collars set them to drain all night. Next day, after
wiping them dry, place the rolls of meat in a jar that
will just hold them without squeezing, and pour clarified
mutton suet with sweet lard in the proportion of
a quarter of a pound of the latter to twelve ounces of
the former, and when cold covering the meat to the
thickness of two inches. Tie wet bladder over and
put away in a cold airy room. This should not be
broached under two months, and then by placing the
jar in a pan of boiling water for twenty minutes you
can take out a collar and put away the jar, taking care
that the meat is totally covered by the suet and made
safe from the air. Pop the collar into a saucepan of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
boiling water and salt for fifteen minutes, then take it
out, wipe it dry, and when nearly cold take off the envelopes
and set it by till next day. Serve it garnished
with fresh parsley and slices of lemon or pickled red
beetroot, which two latter may be eaten with it, and
then I think you will confess that this “common part
of venison” is very first-rate eating.</p>

<p>You may not expect any thing particularly good as
a relish from so common an article as a beef’s heart,
but I often think there is more credit due to a person
for producing a choice relish from what is considered
an inferior base, than in spoiling an expensive natural
production in the attempt to improve it. In this
case I fear not to give satisfaction. The expense is
really trifling, and the trouble reducible to a pleasure.
Get a fine ox heart, with plenty of fat on it, hang
it up a dry room, but not in an air current, for a
week; then empty the cavities of the clotted blood,
cut out the deaf ears as low down internally as your
knife will reach, cut open a communication between
the upper cavities and the lower ones, but on no account<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">ESSENCE OF LOBSTERS.</p>

<p>Boil six pounds of live lobsters thus: Throw them
into salt and water and with a brush clean them well,
tie up the tails, and pop them into a pan of boiling
water, in which a good handful of salt and half an
ounce of saltpetre have been dissolved; then set them
to cool, take out all the meat and coral, which, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
it has been cleared of the skins, chop up into dice, and
set it on the fire in a clean pan, with a pound and a half
of bay salt and two quarts of water, and let it simmer
twenty minutes. Then take out the fish, pound it in
a mortar with half an ounce of cayenne pepper and
the same quantity of finely powdered mace, bring it
to a nice paste with some of the water last used, and
put it again into the pan with the remainder of the
water and let it simmer half an hour. When cold, or
nearly so, fill your clean glass jars with it, cork them
well and seal them.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">ESSENCE OF SHRIMPS.</p>

<p>Put a gallon of live shrimps into a pan of three
quarts of boiling water, in which a pound and half of
bay salt or rock salt has been dissolved, skim them
well and boil them ten minutes, strain off the water
through a sieve, and while the shrimps are warm pull
off the heads, which with unsound ones put aside. Boil
one pound of bay salt with two quarts of water ten
minutes, skimming it well, and set it by to get cold.
Pound the shrimps in a mortar with their skins to a
paste, using a little of the last water, and when it has
been well worked add the remainder of the water,
boiled and strained, with this mixture:</p>

<h3 style="display: none; visibility: hidden;">Preserved Fruits</h3>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">TO PREPARE SYRUP FOR PRESERVING FRUIT.</p>

<p>The best refined sugar, which will require no
clarifying, should invariably be used for this process;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
but when inferior qualities are chosen they must be
prepared in the following manner: To clarify six
pounds of sugar, break it into large lumps, put it
into a preserving pan, and pour upon it five pints of
cold spring water; in another pint of water beat up
lightly the white of one small egg, but not frothing
it very much, add it to the sugar, and stir it to mix
it well with the whole. Set the pan over a gentle
fire, when the sugar is nearly dissolved, and let the
scum rise without being disturbed; when the syrup
has boiled five minutes, take it off the fire, let it stand
two minutes, and then skim it very clean, let it boil
again, then throw in half a cupful of cold water,
which will bring the remainder of the scum to the
surface; skim it until it is perfectly clear, strain it
through a thin cloth, and it will be ready for use, or
for further boiling.</p>

<p>All <em>unripe</em> fruit must be rendered perfectly tender
by gentle scalding, before it is put into syrup, or it
will not imbibe the sugar; and the syrup must be
<em>thin</em> when it is first added to it, and be thickened
afterwards by frequent boiling, or with sugar added,
or the fruit will shrivel instead of becoming plump
and clear. A pound of sugar boiled for ten minutes
in a pint of water will make a very light syrup, but
it will gradually thicken if rapidly boiled in an uncovered
pan. Two pounds of sugar to the pint of
water will become thick with little more than half an
hour’s boiling, or with three or four separate boilings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
of eight or ten minutes each; if too much reduced it
will candy, instead of remaining liquid.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">WEST INDIA PRESERVED GREEN GINGER.</p>

<p class="unindent">which boil five minutes, then simmer for half an
hour, in a closely covered pan, strain the liquor
through a flannel bag, and add to each pint of it one
and a quarter pounds of sifted loaf-sugar, making a
syrup, which must be clarified with the white of egg.
Boil this, and skim with care till no scum rises. Peel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
the cucumbers, and cut them in pieces the size and
shape of a pigeon’s egg. Simmer two ounces more
of bruised ginger, tied in a piece of muslin, in a pint
of water, till reduced to a moderate sized teacupful,
and add it to the syrup. Take the ginger you first
used, put it with the syrup and cucumbers into a
clean pan, and boil for ten minutes. Empty all into
a clean earthenware jar, and let stand two days and
nights. Next pour off the syrup, boil it five minutes,
taking off the scum if any arises; then add the cucumbers,
boil five minutes longer, and put all back
again into the jar, and let stand three days. Return
the syrup and the whole of the ginger tied in muslin
into the pan, and boil until the syrup adheres to the
spoon. Then put in the cucumbers, and boil, a quarter
of an hour, when return all into the jar, and let remain
twenty-four hours uncovered. Then tie wet bladder
well over, and in a month it may be removed into
small wide-mouthed glass jars and covered with
bladder, and green paper over that. This, as dessert,
is an excellent stomachic, assisting digestion in weak
habits.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">CURRANTS FOR TARTS.</p>

<p>The fruit for these purposes should be gathered on
fine days, and only the best used for preserves. Press
the juice from the rejected currants, and strain it
clear. To each pound of fruit you must allow a
pound of the best refined sugar, and make a fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
clear syrup of the currant juice and sugar. When
it is cold put in your fruit and let it boil until beautifully
clear, when you may put it into pots and glass
jars, covering with brandy paper and wetted bladder.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">TOMATOES.</p>

<p>The fruit here must be taken before it is quite
ripe, and if not having lost its green hue quite may
be preferable; and for three pounds of fruit take off
the thin yellow rinds of two large lemons, and, squeezing
out the juice, strain it and put it aside for awhile.
Put the juice with the thin rinds into a clean saucepan,
with two or three blades of mace, a few peach
leaves and a dessert-spoonful of ginger sliced thinly;
cover the tomatoes with water barely, and set the pan
on a clear fire to simmer half an hour. Then take out
the fruit carefully with a spoon and set them on a
sieve to cool. Add to the water they were simmered
in sugar sufficient to make a thin syrup, which must
be poured over the fruit, when placed in a deep dish,
boiling hot, and so leave them for four or five days.
Then pour out the syrup into a pan, and add sugar
to make a strong syrup, into which you may put the
tomatoes and simmer them gently until the syrup has
entered fully into them. Remove them now from
the fire and let them remain unmolested for four
or five days longer. If the syrup has now not attained
a proper consistence, you may add sugar, and
boil until you have got the desired end. Pour now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
on the fruit while it is hot, and if when cold you are
satisfied, make all safe with bladder and leather, and
keep in a cool and airy room.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">CUCUMBERS.</p>

<p>This is an elegant preserve if well managed. Take
two dozen of the finest, largest, and most clear cucumbers,
and without seeds. Cut them into pieces, take
out the very soft part of the insides, put them into a jar
with strong salt and water to cover them, and set them
in a warm situation until they become yellow. Now
wash them well, and set them in a pan of water, with
plenty of fresh cabbage leaves, on the fire, close the
lid of the pan, so that no steam can escape, and simmer
them until of a fine green colour. If you have
not yet attained your object, change the water and
leaves, and simmer them again. Then take out the
fruit, set it on a sieve to cool, and then into pure cold
water for three or four days, changing the water
daily. Put into a clean pan four pounds of the best
refined sugar, with one quart of pure spring water,
boil and skim it well. Then add the rinds of four
large lemons pared very thin, and three ounces of the
best ginger sliced, and boil all together ten minutes.
Take it then off the fire, and when cool put in the
cucumbers, and boil them until they are perfectly
clear. If their appearance does not fully satisfy you,
set them aside for forty-eight hours, and then repeat
the boiling, and putting your cucumbers into your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
pots and glasses, pour the syrup over them, and secure
them from the air with bladder and leather, or with
paper over the glasses.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">GREEN-GAGE PLUMS.</p>

<p>From a peck of this rich fruit, pick out all the
largest and most clear. Put a handful of vine leaves
into a pan, then a layer of the fruit, and so on, in
alternate layers, to the end; fill the vessel up with
water, put them over a moderate fire, and let them get
thoroughly hot through, skim them well, pour off the
water, and put the plums on a sieve to cool. Now
take off the peels carefully, and, as you proceed, put
them into the water they were heated in, with fresh
leaves, and let them boil three minutes, preventing
the escape of the steam as much as you possibly can.
Let them remain at a moderate distance from the fire
seven or eight hours, or until they become green; then
put them on a sieve to drain, and then boil them up in
a good clear syrup once a day, for three successive
days. Then take them up, and place in clean dry
glasses and jars; skim the syrup thoroughly over the
fire, and, when nearly cold, pour it over the plums,
put brandy paper upon them, and cover with bladder.
You will have an elegant and very rich preserve.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">PEACHES AND NECTARINES.</p>

<p>Before they are ripe, take the choicest of these
fruit, rub off the down from them with soft old linen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
and divide the skin at the seam with a sharp pointed
knife. Put them into a clean jar, cover them with
French brandy, and let them remain so for ten days;
then take them out, and having ready a fine clear
syrup, put the fruit into a pan with it, and boil them
until they are beautifully bright and clear. When
cold, take out the fruit, place it in glasses and jars,
and fill up with the syrup nearly cold. Lay brandy
paper over and cover with bladder.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">LEMONS PRESERVED.</p>

<p>Take two dozen fine lemons, wipe them well, and
pare off the yellow rind very thin. Cut out a piece of
the rind at the blossom end, and take out the whole
of the pulp and seeds. Rub the lemons over with
fine bay salt, and lay them in cold water, so let them
lie for a week, quite covered, and then boil them in
fresh salt and water twenty minutes. Now prepare
a syrup of one pound of the best loaf sugar to a quart
of water, and well skimmed, and into which put the
lemons, and boil them five or six minutes for four
days successively, then place them in a jar and let
them stand six weeks, and all the time well covered
with the syrup. Now make a clear, thick, fine
syrup of the best refined sugar and water, put the
lemons into it, and boil them gently for ten minutes;
then put them away, and in twenty-four hours boil
them again at short intervals, until they look plump
and clear. Now lay them in jars and glasses, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
pour the syrup over them cold; cover with brandy-paper
and tie bladder over them.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">APRICOTS.</p>

<p>Take two dozen of the largest and soundest
apricots when they are just fully ripe, wipe them clear
from gum and other filth; push the stones out
through the stalk ends with a blunted piece of wood;
weigh the fruit now, and for each pound of apricots,
allow one pound of the best refined sugar, the half of
which, when reduced to a powder and sifted, you
must strew over the fruit, and let them remain so for
twenty-four hours. Boil them up gently, and when
they have been cold repeat the boiling four or five
times, at intervals of three hours, by which means
they will have become clear and bright. Now take
them up and lay them on a sieve, and when you
have prepared a good clear thick syrup, boil the fruit
up in it for five minutes, and skimming it well. Then
put the apricots into clear glass jars, and pour the
syrup over them. When cold make all safe with
writing paper steeped in brandy, and tie wetted bladder
over. They must be stored in a dry, airy room.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">DAMSONS.</p>

<p>Choose the finest, large prune damsons for this
purpose, pick them over carefully, throwing out the
stalks, and all that are the least crushed, cut them
open lengthwise, and take out the stones, put them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
into a pan with water sufficient to cover them, and
boil them ten minutes; turn them out upon a sieve,
and when cold, or nearly so, wipe each separately
with some old soft linen or flannel. To each pound
of the fruit allow one pound of the best refined sugar,
the half of which, after being sifted finely, you must
scatter equally over the damsons, on large dishes; put
the other half of the sugar to the water in which the
fruit was scalded, set it in a pan on a clear fire, and
let it boil up; skim it thoroughly, and then simmer
only, for ten or twelve minutes; put in the fruit and
bring it to a boil; then take it off the fire, and let it
stand, closely covered, half an hour; then put it again
to simmer for half an hour longer, and then put it
aside until the next day. Now boil up the fruit until
it is tender, put the damsons into a sieve while warm,
and boil the jelly alone full half an hour, and taking
off any scum that may yet have arisen. Put the fruit
into your pots, jars, &amp;c., and pour your jelly over
them, well heated. When cold, put brandy-paper
upon the fruit, and melted mutton suet above that.
Make all safe with bladder and leather, and store
them in a dry, airy, cool room.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">MORELLO CHERRIES.</p>

<p>Pick thoroughly ripe and sound fruit from the
stalks and wipe them separately; prick them with a
needle in three or four places. To each pound of
fruit allow one pound and a half of the best sugar,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
and strew one half of it when finely sifted over the
cherries upon clean large dishes, and let them remain
so for twenty-four hours. Take now as much strained
red-currant juice as will effectually dissolve the other
half of the sugar, and put it into a pan over a moderate
fire, and let it boil twelve or fifteen minutes,
skim it well, add to it the fruit with their sugar, and
let all simmer five minutes, being careful to not allow
them to boil. Then remove the cherries into glasses,
boil the syrup until it is thick and pour it cool over
them. When cold guard them with brandy paper,
and paste writing paper neatly cut over the glasses.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">BARBERRIES IN SPRIGS AND BUNCHES.</p>

<p>Pick out the finest bunches and sprigs of fine ripe
clear berries—reject all faulty ones—lay them in as
much water as will be requisite for making their syrup,
and boil them until they are tender. Now strain them
upon a sieve, and to every pint of their juice add a
pound and half of best refined sugar, boil and skim
this thoroughly, and to each pint of the syrup put half
a pound of the fruit in bunches and boil them very
gently until they become quite bright and clear.
When cold put them into clear glasses and pour the
syrup to them. Use brandy paper, and paste writing
paper over the glasses.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">HAMBURGH GRAPES PRESERVED WHOLE.</p>

<p>Pick out some handsome little bunches, wipe them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
very carefully with soft old linen moistened with
spirits and water, place them in a wide jar, and allow
one ounce of white sugar-candy beaten small to each
pound of the grapes, which, as the fruit is placed, must
be scattered equally amongst it. Fill the jar up with
French brandy, the best, and seeing in two days
afterwards that the fruit is properly covered, make up
safely with bladder and leather, and store away in a
cool airy room.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">GOLDEN PIPPINS</p>

<p>Pare two dozen fine pippins nicely, cut them into
quarters and take out the cores. Boil the rinds of
two fine large oranges in a pan of cold water until perfectly
tender and lay them in pure spring water for
three days. Put these into a pan, just cover them
with water and let them boil twenty minutes, and
strain the juice through a jelly-bag; then pare two
dozen more pippins, take out the cores at the stalk
ends neatly. Make now a fine clear syrup of two
pounds of the best refined sugar and one pint of water,
to which add the apple juice, and when it is cold put
in the pippins, adding the orange peel cut into thin
chips. Boil it very gently ten minutes, then take out
the pippins, and when cool put them into jars and pour
the syrup over them. Apply brandy paper, and tie
bladder over the jars, and leather over that. Some
adopt the mutton suet melted, with one-eighth of its
weight of sweet lard added, which corrects the brittleness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
of the suet and causes it to adhere better to the
sides of the jars.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">RASPBERRY MARMALADE.</p>

<p>Pick fresh ripe raspberries from the stalks and simmer
them gently about ten minutes, keeping them
stirred all the time. Pour them and their juice into a
clean hair sieve and rub them through it with a
wooden spoon, leaving only the seeds behind. Weigh
the fruit and boil it quickly for eight or ten minutes,
then take the pan from the fire and stir gradually into
it three quarters of a pound of sugar to the pound of
pulp. When this is quite dissolved continue the boiling
for another ten minutes—less time will occasionally
be sufficient, but the thickness of the preserve
and the manner in which it jellies on the skimmer will
show when it is boiled enough. The raspberries may
be rubbed through a sieve without the previous simmering,
then mixed with their weight of sugar and
boiled quickly for twenty minutes. Rich strawberry
jam or marmalade is made in precisely the same
manner.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">JAM OF MORELLO CHERRIES.</p>

<p>This is a delicious preserve when made with fine
ripe morellos. Stone the fruit, weigh it, heat it rather
slowly to draw out the juice, then boil it quickly for
twenty minutes over a very clear fire, add thirteen
ounces of sugar for each pound of the cherries, and
boil the jam from fifteen to twenty minutes longer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
being careful to clear off all the scum. The sugar
should be of good quality; it must be beaten to powder
and added gradually to the fruit, and stirred with
it off the fire until it is dissolved. A larger portion
may be used when the morellos are very acid. An
equal weight with the cherries will not be too much
for some tastes, but their flavour will be better preserved
with less. A few of the kernels blanched and
wiped quite dry may be added a couple of minutes
before the jam is poured out.

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">RED CABBAGE.<br>
A RECEIPT FROM HALTON CASTLE.</p>

<p>Take two middle-sized close-knit red cabbages, just
when the frost has seasoned them, strip them of all
superfluous leaves, cut them across in slices nearly a
quarter of an inch thick, and scatter finely beaten bay
or rock salt over them when laid on large dishes and
covered with cloths; so let them lie twenty-four hours.
Next drain the cabbage on a sieve and let it remain
until the next day, still covered over. Put it into one
jar that will contain it without pressure, and strew as
you proceed pretty plentifully the following mixture
amongst and finally upon the cabbage:</p>

<table>
<colgroup>
  <col span="1" style="width: 11em;">
  <col span="1" style="width: 2em;">

</table>

<p class="unindent"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
Now pour pure cold best London pickling vinegar into
the jar, and take care that the cabbage is perfectly
covered, and to the depth of an inch or more. Make
up the jar with a bung, and secure it with resin or
pitch. In a month you will have perhaps the best article
of its kind to be found anywhere, its excellency
consisting in its flavour, its colour, and crispness.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">GREEN SAMPHIRE.</p>

<p>Carefully pick out the refuse from a peck of fresh
samphire as soon as you get it, or it will be tough by
delay. Immerse the accepted branches in salt and
water strong brine for two days, then take it up and
dry with cloths, place it lightly in a pan, and cover it
with spring water in which a handful of salt and half
an ounce of saltpetre have been dissolved, and put it
on the fire to simmer, taking it off the moment that a
thick steam comes upon the surface, and add for every
quart of water used in the mouth of each jar a small
teaspoonful of gum kino. Then make the jars secure
with bladder and keep for use.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">CAULIFLOWERS.</p>

<p>Purchase for pickling the closest, soundest, and
whitest, entirely free from grub and insect, and pull
them into nice branches and sprigs. Lay them loosely
on large dishes, and scatter table salt generally through
and over them, let them remain thus for three days.
Next place them neatly in jars, and pour boiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
water upon them, tie leather over, and let them stand
by twelve or fourteen hours, then dry them on a sieve
and remove them to glass jars, filling them up with
the following pickle when cold:</p>

</table>

<p class="unindent">This must be boiled twenty minutes, and skimmed
quite clear. Let olive oil float at the top of the
pickle, in the jars, to the depth of half an inch. Then
cover with bladder.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">WHITE MUSHROOMS.</p>

<p>Choose the smallest, round, perfect buttons, rub
each separately with a piece of soft old flannel, wetted
with a solution of bay salt, and let them be thoroughly
cleansed after they are all rubbed. (See note, No. 11).
When all ready put them into a pan with a little
finely powdered bay salt scattered over them, and
covered so closely that not the least steam can escape,
for ten or twelve minutes, or until the water is extracted
from them. Then get them removed, without
any delay, on to a sieve, then dry them well with
cloths, and let them get cold, effectually covered up
from the action of the air. Make the following light
pickle, by boiling it and skimming it well, and, laying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
your mushrooms in clean glass jars, pour it amongst
and upon them:</p>

</table>

<p class="unindent">When the bottles are nearly filled with the pickle, let
olive oil float on the top for an inch in depth, then
make safe with bladder, and keep dry and cool. In
a month they will be fit for use.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">SILVER ONIONS.</p>

<p>Select your onions well, for many attempts at pickling
them have been rendered abortive by the bad
quality of the raw material. They should be globular
and sound, and have the appearance of being got up
in dry weather, and been well dried by the air and
sun previous to being stored. The peeling will, however,
prove much, and if you are suspicious of having
been not well served, do not proceed with them.

Peel a peck of nice onions, and, as you proceed,
throw them into plenty of strong salt and water, and
let them remain so for ten or twelve days, changing
the pickle every second day. Set them now on a
sieve to drain, then put them into jars and pour on
them a brine freshly made of bay salt and water,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
boiling hot, and, covering up close, let them remain
till cold. Repeat the scalding and with fresh pickle,
and when drained thoroughly, put them into jars
with</p>

</table>

<p class="unindent">scattered amongst them, and fill up with the vinegar
cold. Let olive oil float on the top, for nearly an
inch deep, and secure the jars with wetted bladder,
and, that dried, soft leather above all. For the preservation
of the colour, this attention to the exclusion
of the air is chiefly owing. These are of first-rate
quality, and are much resorted to in the kitchens of
the wealthy.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">PRESERVED WALNUTS.</p>

<p>Take half a hundred of walnuts just when they
are ready for pickling, that is, when punctured with
a pin no shell can be perceived. Take a jar that will
a little above hold them, deposit in it a layer of coarse-sugar
half an inch thick, on this make a layer of
walnuts well wiped, and every one sound, then a layer
of sugar, and so on alternately to near the top of the
jar. The allowance of sugar must be half a pound
to every score of nuts. Tie coarse paper over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
mouth of the jar and place it in a saucepan of boiling
water, in which it must remain three hours. This
will dissolve the sugar; the syrup should now cover
the fruit; if it does not, add some more sugar and
continue the simmering. When cold, cover the mouth
of the jar with bladder, and do not disturb them for
six months, for the longer kept the better they will
be. These will be found of excellent and extensive use
in families of many children as a gentle aperient medicine.
One is a dose for a child of five to seven
years old, and so in advancing ratio, and instead of
proving nauseous to young palates, will be regarded
as a treat, and, if I am not mistaken, adults will occasionally
be troubled with constipation.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">APPLE MARMALADE.</p>

<p>Pare and core two pounds of rather acid apples,
put them into an enamelled pan with a pint of sweet
cider, or with half a pint of cape wine, and a pound
of crushed good loaf sugar, and cook them slowly by
a gentle heat three hours. Squeeze the fruit first
through a colander and then through a sieve. If not
sweet enough add powdered sugar to your taste. Put
it in small white jars, cover with bladder and writing
paper. It will be very nice, and extremely wholesome
as supper for the juveniles, and for the aged, eaten
with cream or milk.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
<p class="p2 center allsmcap">RED CURRANTS.</p>

<p>Take currants for this purpose just before they
have attained a perfect red colour. Select the nicest
bunches, which keep separate, and accept no single
ones but what are clear and sound. Boil these with
the fruit until the colour of the vinegar is changed by it,</p>

fruit into glass jars or tumblers, and pour the liquor
hot upon them, so as to cover totally; then tie paper
and bladder closely over.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">CELERY.</p>

<p>The white part only is used for this purpose. Wash
very clean half a dozen fine heads, and wipe them
dry. Cut them into pieces to your taste, and make
the following pickle:</p>

Put all these into a deep saucepan, and soon as they
come to the boiling point, strew in the celery; let it
boil again, not more than two minutes, then take it
up, pour it through a sieve. When cold, place the
celery in jars, and pour the liquor upon it, and make
all safe with bladder, &amp;c. &amp;c. This will be found
extremely useful in all families that live well. It will
keep good a great length of time, and when the
celery is all used, the pickle will be highly acceptable
in dressing salads, &amp;c. A few small onions may be
added where they are not disliked, and omitted at
pleasure.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">GRAPES.</p>

<p>The foreign grapes, if got in the beginning of the
importations to this country, for then they are less
likely to be decayed or specked, answer extremely
well for pickling, and are, of course, much cheaper
than those grown at home. The white ones are
generally chosen; but it appears to me that a mixture
of the purple ones with them makes an agreeable
change, as far as the appearance is concerned. Take
ten pounds of the largest and soundest you can, and
divide into little branches, which place in a deep
straight-sided stone jar, embedded in vine leaves, and
completely cover them with this mixture:</p>

<p>These must be taken when about the size of hen-eggs,
and none but perfectly sound ones accepted.
Wrap them up singly in vine leaves recently plucked,
and place them lightly in a saucepan, with plenty of
leaves under, amongst, and above them, and thoroughly
cover them with water. Boil them slowly until the
peels begin to start, and separate, then carefully take
them up, and drain them on a sieve. When cold,
pare them carefully, and, replacing them in the pan,
cover so well that none of the steam can escape, and
continue the simmering until they are of a nice green
colour. Now take them up, and let them drain, and
get cold. Put them into little jars, and cover the
fruit with white-wine vinegar, put a round of pasteboard
on the top, and pour in melted mutton suet.
Tie bladder over and leather above that, and keep
them cool and dry for three or four months. They
will be a good pickle at a little expense.</p>

<p>These are more useful as garnishes than otherwise,
and a great many are annually pickled for that purpose.
Take half a sieve of fine, high-coloured fruit,
pick out all the nice bunches that are sound, and
keep them apart by themselves; the best of the single
ones must also be had, but put in separate jars.
Wash both in salt and water, and set them to drain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
Now take two and a half pounds of bay salt to each
gallon of water, and fill up the jars with the mixture,
to running over; skim them daily for four or five
days, and then pour the liquor away, and fill the jars
again with a similar mixture of salt and water, adding
half a pint of the strongest pickling vinegar. Let
it merely steam over the fire, until it has become
crisp and finely green, then take it off quickly, and
let it cool, drain off the liquor, and put the fruit
along with a light scattering of the following mixture
into a jar, and cover it well with the liquor:</p>

peel them carefully, then lay them again in the water,
adding nearly a pint of good sharp vinegar, and continue
the simmering until they become a nice green

<p>Pickled beet-roots which have both fine colour and

is tried, it will most certainly recommend them. Take
half a dozen roots of the deepest blood-red colour,
put them into a pail of cold water, and with a soft
brush scour and wash them well, and without breaking
the skin in the least. Put them into a saucepan
of boiling water, and let them boil gently until tender,
and no longer, then take them up, wipe dry, and
leave them until the next day. Now peel them
nicely, and cut them across in slices a quarter of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>

<h3><span class="allsmcap">NOTES.</span></h3>

<p>It has been incontestably proved by Baron Liebig and
other Professors of Chemistry, that the albumen and gelatine
constitute the leading nutritive ingredients in the
different kinds of flesh and fish used as food; and I have
arrived at the conclusion, that any mode of curing which
deprives them of these valuable properties, is opposed to
facts in science and to common-sense, and cannot therefore
be tolerated.</p>

<p>On the nutritive properties of animal food, Professor
Brande writes: “When the muscular parts of animals are
washed repeatedly in cold water, the fibrinous matter which
remains, consists chiefly of albumen, and is, in its chemical
properties, analogous to the clot of blood.”</p>

<p>In mutton, the albumen or fibrin amounts to as much as
twenty-two per cent., and of gelatine to seven per cent.,
giving a total of twenty-nine per cent. of nutritive matter.
In beef, the albumen is twenty, and the gelatine six per
cent., yielding a total of twenty-six per cent. of nutritive
matter.</p>

<p>When a piece of meat is covered with salt, or immersed
in brine, the salt penetrates the whole fibre of the flesh, and
the juices contained within are drawn out, and mix with the
brine; the salts of potass contained in it, are exchanged
and superseded by those of soda, derived from <em>the salt</em> with
which it has been cured; now, as a constant supply of
potass is required in the system to renew the muscular fibre,
it is quite clear that the want of it must be attended with
some derangement of the health; and hence the benefit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
derived from the taking of vegetables, which by supplying
potass, make up for the want of this alkali in the meat.</p>

<p>Albumen is coagulated by heat, and is drawn out by cold
water; this fact is referred to in Note, No. 11.</p>

<p class="p2">No. 1. The coating of small articles, of the better sorts,
excludes the air. It is a mixture of gelatine with treacle,
applied when hot, and which when exposed to the air becomes
hardened, yet elastic as india-rubber. See Note,
No. 12.</p>

<p>No. 2. The smoking with different sorts of fuel exerts a
considerable influence on the flavour and preservation of
the articles so treated; for example, the mutton of the
Ardennes forest, Belgium, which owes its superiority to the
juniper bushes with which it is dried and smoked. And
again, kippered salmon smoked with cedar-wood, at the
request of some of our wealthy Jew families, is excellent,
though rather expensive.</p>

<p>No. 3. The spicing of bacon was adopted some years
since, and chiefly in Ireland, to hide the inferior quality of
the meat.</p>

<p>No. 4. Bay salt is far preferable to common salt for
curing meats and fish, but the expense deters many persons
from using it, except in small quantities. The rock, or
mineral salt of Cheshire, is equal in all respects to the bay
salt of commerce, and I have long used it with the greatest
success. Common salt leaves a <em>bitter</em> smatch on all food
cured with it after being long kept. See Note, No. 12.</p>

<p>No. 5. There is no remedy for over-salted provisions.
You may, indeed, cut them into slices and lay them in
water, but this only affects the outsides of large pieces, as
hams, &amp;c. If I had a ham that I suspected of being over
salted, I should put it in an old bag, and bury it in my
garden for a week or more, according to size.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
No. 6. Rubbing large joints of meat over with a profusion
of common salt, and letting them lie, to “draw out
the blood,” as it is termed, is contrary to all reason, for
away goes the chief part of the flavour and nutriment.</p>

<p>No. 7. Sprats are so different in their animal construction
as to be easily detected from genuine fish—Gorgona
anchovies. The Armenian bole, often made use of to
colour the sauce, has very properly been exposed and condemned.</p>

<p>No. 8. Pure olive oil will preserve meat and fish, after
it has been cured, for a long time; but oils drawn from
lard and other spurious imitations, will not fail to hasten
their decay. The oil should never be heated, when used
for this purpose.</p>

<p>No. 9. Subjecting meats to a water-bath is not to be
resorted to. I was shown a specification previous to the
taking out of a patent (in France, by a French gentleman)
to cure the more expensive sorts of fish. The first part of
the process proposed, was subjecting the fish to a water-bath,
first for three hours, and, changing the water, then to
two hours further immersion in warm water. I, of course,
entered my protest against such unreasonable treatment.
I am sure I could not conjecture what became of both
flavour and nutriment after so long immersion.</p>

<p>No. 10. Meats to be boiled, and particularly fish, must
be put into <em>boiling</em> water, and after being kept up to the
boiling point fifteen minutes or so, let them only simmer
until done.</p>

<p>No. 11. The albumen is drawn out from both meat, fish,
and vegetables by cold water; how, then, can we reconcile
ourselves with the foolish old practice of laying the heads,
for instance, and other parts, in pails of water, and leaving
them for hours in that state, to lose all their goodness.
Vegetables for pickling, too, are often treated in this way.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
Lying in water cannot possibly <em>clean</em> anything. Wash
well, and hang up to dry, is more reasonable.</p>

<p>No. 12. A very effective <em>coating</em> for small cured articles
is made thus: To four pounds of hard, compact gelatine,
add as much soft or rain-water as will just cover it, and
stir it about occasionally for six hours. When it has stood
twenty-four hours, and all the water is absorbed, submit it
to the action of heat in a water-bath, and the gelatine will
be quickly dissolved. Take it off the fire as soon as the
froth is perceived to rise, and mix with it three and a half
pounds of molasses, which has previously been made
thoroughly hot. Stir the composition well together while
in the water-bath over the fire, not suffering it to boil.
After it has been thus subjected to heat for half an hour,
and well stirred all the time, it should be taken off the fire
and allowed to cool a little; it is now ready for use, and to
be applied to the article of food with a soft brush. Set it
in a current of air to harden quickly. A second paying-over
with the composition may be done with advantage
sometimes. For larger articles, as hams, &amp;c. &amp;c., the best
transparent glue may be used instead of gelatine, adding to
the composition, when a little cooled, a few drops of essence
of nutmegs or pimento. If when cold the coating is found
to be not firm enough, the proportion of gelatine or glue
must be slightly increased, and when, on the contrary, it is
too brittle, the quantity of molasses may be increased.</p>

<p>No. 13. For the accommodation of parties residing at a
distance, peat or bog-earth, rock salt from the Cheshire
mines, charcoal, &amp;c. &amp;c., may be had, ready for immediate,
use, on application to Mr. Robinson, provision curer, Runcorn,
Cheshire, and on very moderate terms.</p>
